This project is for the Washington State University 2025 hackathon. The hackathon was a 24 hour challenge and the theme was "art in innovation." 
My partner (@jaydenclaytor) and I designed a program in C that calculated one of 9 different Julia set fractals and displayed it onto the screen 
for the user. To do the graphics, we learned how to use the functions of raylib.h. The goal for this project was to show the beauty of fractals 
and to educate on the importance of fractals in nature; fractals represent many naturally occurring phenomena such as the structure of seashells, 
lungs, and snowflakes. It was a very fun project and I learned a lot. I started learning how to code in January and this competition has caused me 
the most growth in my programming skills thus far.

What I learned:
1) How to program and communicate with a team/partner.
2) How to use the raylib.h and complex.h libraries for C.
3) How to program graphics at all, let alone in C.
4) How to do arithmetic with complex numbers.
5) How to create fractals based on mathematical operations.
